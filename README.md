## Introduction

Roller CLI is a command-line interface tool designed to facilitate the creation
and operation of RollApps on the Dymension Hub.
It allows developers to effortlessly spin up and run RollApps, simplifying the
development process and making the Dymension Hub
more accessible.

## Local Development

```bash

```

This command builds the latest version of Roller and places the executable

```bash
./build/roller
```
